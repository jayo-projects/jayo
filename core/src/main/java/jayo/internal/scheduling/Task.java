/**
 * A unit of work that can be executed one or more times.
 * <h3>Scheduled task recurrence</h3>
 * Tasks control their recurrence schedule. The {@link ScheduledTask#runOnce()} function returns -1L to signify that the task should
 * not be executed again. Otherwise, it returns a delay until the next execution.
 * <p>
 * A task has at most one next execution. If the same task instance is scheduled multiple times, the earliest one wins.
 * This applies to both executions scheduled directly and the scheduled tasks implied by the returned execution delay.
 * <h3>Cancellation</h3>
 * Tasks may be canceled while they are waiting to be executed, or while they are executing.
 * <p>
 * Canceling a task that is waiting to execute prevents that upcoming execution. Canceling a task that is currently
 * executing does not impact the ongoing run, but it does prevent a recurrence from being scheduled.
 * <p>
 * Tasks may opt out of cancellation using the {@code cancellable} constructor parameter. Such tasks will recur until
 * they decide not to by returning -1L.
 * <h3>Task Queues</h3>
 * Tasks are bound to the {@link RealTaskQueue} they are scheduled in. Each queue is sequential and the tasks within it
 * never execute concurrently. It is an error to use a task in multiple queues.
