     * Shuts down the TLS connection. This method emulates the behavior of OpenSSL's
     * <a href="https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Manual:SSL_shutdown(3)">SSL_shutdown()</a>.
     * <p>
     * The shutdown procedure consists of two steps: the sending of the "close notify" shutdown alert and the reception
     * of the peer's "close notify". According to the TLS standard, it is acceptable for an application to only send its
     * shutdown alert and then close the underlying connection without waiting for the peer's response. When the
     * underlying connection shall be used for more communications, the complete shutdown procedure (bidirectional
     * "close notify" alerts) must be performed so that the peers stay synchronized.
     * <p>
     * This class supports both uni- and bidirectional shutdown by its 2-step behavior, using this method.
     * <p>
     * When this is the first party to send the "close notify" alert, this method will only send the alert, set the
     * {@link #isShutdownSent()} flag and return {@code false}. If a unidirectional shutdown is enough, this first
     * call is enough. To complete the bidirectional shutdown handshake, This method must be called again. The second
     * call will wait for the peer's "close notify" shutdown alert. On success, the second call will return
     * {@code true}.
     * <p>
     * If the peer already sent the "close notify" alert, and it was already processed implicitly inside a read
     * operation, the {@link #isShutdownReceived()} flag is already set. This method will then send the "close notify"
     * alert, set the {@link #isShutdownSent()} flag and immediately return {@code true}. It is therefore recommended
     * to check the return value of this method and call it again if the bidirectional shutdown is not yet complete.
     * <p>
     * Note that despite not being mandated by the specification, a proper TLS close is important to prevent truncation
     * attacks. It consists, essentially, of an adversary introducing TCP FIN segments to trick on party to ignore
     * the final bytes of a secure stream. For more details, see
     * <a href="https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01102013">the original paper</a>.
