/**
 * A pair of streams for interactive communication with a peer using an I/O connection.
 * <p>
 * Send data to the peer by writing to {@linkplain #getWriter() writer}, and read data from the peer by reading from
 * {@linkplain #getReader() reader}.
 * <p>
 * This can be implemented by a plain TCP socket. It can also be layered to add features like security (as in a TLS
 * socket) or connectivity (as in a proxy socket).
 * <p>
 * Closing the {@linkplain #getReader() reader} does not impact the {@linkplain #getWriter() writer}, and vice
 * versa.
 * <p>
 * You must close the reader and the writer to ensure you release the resources held by this socket. If you're using
 * both from the same thread, you can do that with a try with resource block:
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * try (Reader reader = socket.getReader(); Writer writer = socket.getWriter()) {
 *   readAndWrite(reader, writer)
 * }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * A socket is open upon creation until the reader or the writer is closed, or the socket is
 * {@linkplain #cancel() canceled}. Once canceled, any further attempt to read, write or flush will fail immediately
 * with a {@linkplain JayoException JayoException}..
